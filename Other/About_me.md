# About Me

My name is Georgy. I'm finishing my master's degree at MIPT (Russia) next year and considering PhD in EU.

I am a head and maintainer of [Lacmus Foundation](https://lacmus.ml/) - it is an open-source non-profit organization engaged in the search and rescue for missing people using computer vision and neural networks.

Also I have research in the field of image signal processing pipeline (ISP) by applying neural networks for ISP domain adaptation. I am also interested in Computer Vision, edge TPUs and NPUs computing and neural network optimizations.
